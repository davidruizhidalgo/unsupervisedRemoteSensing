function [Zica, W, T, mu] = kICA(Z)
%
% Syntax:       Zica = kICA(Z,r);
%               [Zica, W, T, mu] = kICA(Z,r);
%               
% Inputs:       Z is an d x n matrix containing n samples of d-dimensional
%               data
%               
%               r is the number of independent components to compute
%               
% Outputs:      Zica is an r x n matrix containing the r independent
%               components - scaled to variance 1 - of the input samples
%               
%               W and T are the ICA transformation matrices such that
%               Zr = T \ W' * Zica + repmat(mu,1,n);
%               is the r-dimensional ICA approximation of Z
%               
%               mu is the d x 1 sample mean of Z
%               
% Description:  Performs independent component analysis (ICA) on the input
%               data using the max-kurtosis ICA algorithm
