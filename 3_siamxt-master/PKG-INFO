        ==================================
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        This is an alpha version of the Max-tree toolbox. The toolbox was implemented in Python
        and the critical functions were implemented in C++ and wrapped in Python using SWIG.
        We have a different max-tree structure that is more suitable for matricial processing,
        and allows a fast development of new methods with a reasonable processing time. Our main
        goal in providing this toolbox is to spread the max-tree data structure further among the
        scientific community, investigate it further, and develop new tools that may be applied to
        solve real signal, image processing, and pattern recognition problems. This toolbox works
        for both 2D and 3D images of type uint8.

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        This toolbox requires SWIG, OpenMP, NumPy. 
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The documentation of this toolbox is the same of the iamxt (disconsider drawing functions) and is available at:
        http://adessowiki.fee.unicamp.br/adesso/wiki/iamxt/view/
        
        Install
        -------
        Download the zip file, unzip it and type on terminal:
        sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        Observations
        ---------------
        
        This is the first time that I try to wrap some code for distribution. If you have experience un making distributions and you have tips on how
        to make them more portable, I'll gladly listen to them!
